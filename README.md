Uses Live SASS and Live server.
Attempted to use HTML-validate, however I couldn't get it working.

<h2>Setup:</h2>
Use "npm i" to setup the project

<h2>NOTES:</h2>
Unfortunately due to the limited scope, I was not able to fully utilize SCSS, and I would have like the opportunity to use bootstrap, however it was not needed.
